RobloxLauncher
==============

Launch ROBLOX without the website, given the Place ID.

Requires Java 1.6 or newer.


I created this application because I can no longer launch ROBLOX games from their website (on any browser). When I attempt to,
the ROBLOX updater window would pop up and sit there for several minutes, but never would launch the game. This application
shortcuts the process and launches the game by itself.
